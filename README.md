This project was an attempt to tame the unruly beast that is DocBook.  It was used primarily to render a few of the Maven books from Sonatype.    

Times have changed and writers (myself included) have decided that DocBook is an awful affront to productivity.  Because of this, I'm not longer paying any attention to this repository.     THIS PROJECT IS DORMANT
